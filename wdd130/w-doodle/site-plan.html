      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to our Goldendoodle website. The purpose of this site is to help educate what a goldendoodle is. This includes genetic and generational information that is pertinant to understanding the many varieties of this hybrid/mixed dog. We hope that with the help of this webiste you will feel more confident in making an informed decision what type of goldendoodle is bst for you and your family.
        I'm the breeder behind the Goldendoodle Barn located in Southern California. Even as a young girl I was passionate about nuturing animals! I had always dreamed of starting my own breeding program. I am so blessed to be able to live out that dream as my reality. I have had the opportunity to meet with like-minded breeders and build lifelong friendships. Breeding for me is about raising healthy, quality pups that families can love and adore.
        At the same time I have many individuals reaching out to me to understand the ‘in’s & out’s” of all things doodle. Most importantly, how can they know they are getting a puppy from a reputable breeder. We live in a time when everything is done online, and this opens a lot of doors for scammers to swindle from unsuspecting families. 
        My goal with this website is to give you the tools you need to prevent this from happeneing and finding the perfect dog to join your family, wether that is is a puppy from a breeder like myself, or dopt an older dog. I want to help you make the most informed decision you can. You will learn that transparency is everything!

      <h2>What is a Backyard Breeder?</h2>
        <p>This is a great question. We are glad you asked! The truth is it means different things to different people. But since it is a term, you are likely to hear sometime during your search for the right puppy, it is worth exploring.</p>
      <h2>What is a Goldendoodle?</h2>
        <p>A Goldendoodle is the result of taking an old favorite dog breed, the Golden Retriever and crossing it with the Poodle.</p>

      <h3>What & Why</h3>
      
        <h2>What is a Goldendoodle?</h2>
<p>A Goldendoodle is the result of taking an old favorite dog breed, the Golden Retriever and crossing it with the Poodle. In the case of the Goldendoodle, the desired attributes of the two come together to give the hybrid a fantastic combination of the loyal, friendly, obedient Golden Retriever, with the longer lifespan, high intelligence, low shedding and allergy friendly characteristics of the Poodle. Another added benefit is that the classic flaws of each root breed can be largely alleviated by the hybridization (crossbreed) of the two, leading to the elimination or minimization of many genetic problems (with thorough testing).
</p>
<h2>What types of Goldendoodles are there?</h2>
<p>Goldendoodles come in all colors and sizes.
Most of the time you see F1, F2b, Mulitgen,etc. These indicate what generation or type of goldendoodle you are getting. 
</p>
<p>Goldendoodles are across between a Golden Retriever and a Poodle. The determining factor of the size comes from the Poodle side. The Poodle comes in 3 different sizes: toy, mini, and standard. Poodle sizes are determined by their height, measured from the highest point at the shoulders, down to the floor. When determining the weight of the litter, it is typical to add the weights of the Mother and Father and then divide by 2. The adult weight of the puppy should end up within 10lbs of that weight. That is why it is so critical to know exactly who the parents are to get the best estimate. 
</p>
<h2>Why do Goldendoodles make amazing dogs? </h2>
  <p>Goldendoodles have quickly become one of America’s most loved dog breeds and it’s easy to see why! Whether it’s the non-shedding coat, their eternal loyal and friendly temperament, the active lifestyle or the drop-dead gorgeous looks, it seems the Goldendoodle has captured America’s heart and is here to stay!

      <h3>Where & How</h3>
      
        <h2>What is a Backyard Breeder? </h2>
        <p>The term, Backyard Breeder, original use was likely appropriate and referred to people who would breed dogs irresponsibly, harming individual dogs and tarnishing established breeds because of their lack of care or knowledge about the quality of their breeding dogs. Think "small scale puppy mill" and that is what would have been described as a backyard breeder back when the term first came into use. It would have also meant that the breeder wouldn't stand behind their pups with a guarantee or would mislead buyers regarding the puppy's parentage, etc.Unfortunately, the term has expanded its usage over the years and is now used by some larger breeding operations to disparage those breeders who work their operation out of their home or who only produce a few litters of puppies per year. If you travel around the websites, you are sure to see the term used very broadly and you might get the idea that only a full-time, dedicated, staffed breeder facility could possibly turn out quality puppies. And that is most certainly not true.</p>
        <h2>Puppy</h2>
        <p>The most popular ways to get a Goldendoodle puppy are through a breeder or an adoption organization. However, even within those two choices, there are multiple ways to approach finding your new furry friend. 
        Breeders! 
        Families who are looking to bring a puppy into their home usually utilize a breeder. With a breeder, you’re often able to obtain a lot of detailed information about your new dog. The pedigree and temperament of its parents, its family history of illness, and other facts can help you understand and care for your new pet well.
        However, not all breeders are equal. There are a few different types, and there can be good and bad apples in each.</p>
      <h2>Adopt</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately, there are so many unwanted and discarded dogs who need a second chance at a loving family. Fortunately, this is where you can come in! We recommend continuously checking shelters and adoption organizations before deciding to utilize a breeder. The main reason that families often choose a breeder as where to buy a Goldendoodle dog is that they’d prefer to have a perfect puppy instead of an adult dog. This is a valid desire for families with children or with plenty of extra time to spend raising a dog. </p>
       <h2>Finding and ethical breeder</h2>
       <p>You can find responsible dog breeders by asking for referrals from your veterinarian or trusted friends, by contacting local breed clubs or visiting professional dog shows.Responsible breeders provide their dogs with a high quality of care, which includes: Providing all dogs with quality food, clean water, proper shelter, exercise, socialization and professional veterinary care. Keeping dogs clean and well-groomed. Raising dogs intended to be pets in a home environment.</p><h2>What makes a good Breeder</h2>
       <p>Good breeders want to better the breed and produce a better quality dog. Granted, for doodles there’s no ‘breed standard’ as they’re a mix by definition. But, they want to breed healthy dogs that live long and pain-free lives. Any breeder you consider should 100% be health testing their dogs – and it’s a hard pass for me if they aren’t. An ethical breeder wants to ensure their dogs have good health and isn’t going to breed dogs from bloodlines that have high rates of hip dysplasia and cancer. </p>
      <h2>What to look out for</h2> 
      <p>There are a lot of doodle puppy mills out there. Some are clever at disguising that they’re puppy mills. If you see an ad or a website and you’re concerned that it might be an operation with little regard for the health and quality of their dogs or if you think the seller is trying to scam you, a good idea is to go on doodle groups on social media and ask about the seller/breeder. See what kind of feedback you get and proceed – or don’t – with caution. </p>
