        <h4>Welcome to our Goldendoodle website. The purpose of this site is to help educate what a goldendoodle is. This includes genetic and generational information that is pertinant to understanding the many varieties of this hybrid/mixed dog. We hope that with the help of this webiste you will feel more confident in making an informed decision what type of goldendoodle is bst for you and your family.
            I'm the breeder behind the Goldendoodle Barn located in Southern California. Even as a young girl I was passionate about nuturing animals! I had always dreamed of starting my own breeding program. I am so blessed to be able to live out that dream as my reality. I have had the opportunity to meet with like-minded breeders and build lifelong friendships. Breeding for me is about raising healthy, quality pups that families can love and adore.
            At the same time I have many individuals reaching out to me to understand the ‘in’s & 'out’s” of all things doodle. Most importantly, how can they know they are getting a puppy from a reputable breeder. We live in a time when everything is done online, and this opens a lot of doors for scammers to swindle from unsuspecting families. 
            My goal with this website is to give you the tools you need to prevent this from happeneing and finding the perfect dog to join your family, wether that is is a puppy from a breeder like myself, or dopt an older dog. I want to help you make the most informed decision you can. You will learn that transparency is everything! </h4>

        <h2>What is a Backyard Breeder? </h2>
