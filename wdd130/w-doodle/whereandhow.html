    <h2>Where can I get a Goldendoodle puppy?</h2>

        <p> Puppies are source from quality breeders, hobby breeders, backyard breeders, and sadly puppy mills. Learning how to spot the difference is key to obtaining a puppy of good health and genetics, and most imprtantly as ethical as possible. </p>

    <h2>Where is the best place to adopt an older Goldendoodle? </h2>
    <section class="adopt-card">
                <p>In the case of the Goldendoodle you should look at Golden Retriever Rescues, Poodle Rescues and doodle rescues. On occasion you may be able to find a Golden doodle in need of re-homing through a local shelter or general rescue but it is not common.</p>

                <h2>Good Breeder Checklist</h2>
                <p>Responsible breeders provide their dogs with a high quality of care, which includes: Providing all dogs with quality food, clean water, proper shelter, exercise, socialization and professional veterinary care. Keeping dogs clean and well-groomed.</p>

            <section class="look-out">
                <h2>What to look out for:</h2>
        <p> There is usually no information on the puppies regarding health testing, parental lineage, health guarantees or contracts.
        They did show pictures of the parent dogs in a home setting and of the puppies with the mother dog also in a home. All these clues make me think they are backyard breeder.
        The term backyard breeder is used for someone who does not understand what it takes to breed healthy dogs. Often, they have a popular dog as a pet and they decide they want to make a little money on the side by selling puppies.
        Although they may treat their dogs better than a puppy mill, their lack of knowledge results in unhealthy offspring and a high mortality rate for the puppies.</p>
