        Hello everyone! My name is Jessica Sorensen. I live in Southern, CA, but not the cool beachy part. I live in the high-desert, close to Death Valley. Sadly I hate the desert, SO I try to escape the ugly brown, by visiting my in-laws up in beautifully green Tacoma, WA. </p>

        My major is in Applied Technology as I am working on my BS in 
    Science. I am currently working my way through front end development. 
    I have really enjoyed everything I have learned so far. I am hoping that I will be able to find a career after graduating 
    that will allow me to work remotely.

         I am a stay at home, married 
    mother of 5 kiddos, so I am always busy carting kids around. I also
    breed AKC Golden Retrievers and Goldendoodles. Raising puppies is my 
    favorite thing to do in my limited spare time.  I also love to read and 
    to spend time outside when it's not too hot (it was 115 degrees last week). 
    I just added 16 hen chicks to our crazy little homestead, so I am figuring
    all that out as well. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!
